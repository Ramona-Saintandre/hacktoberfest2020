Usually birthdays are just another day.
But with everything that has gone on this year, and this being my last day in my 40's, there is something humbling about it.
5 years ago I started making major changes in my life.
The first being re- dedicating my line to God and beginning a member of Community church.
Then I started exercising, racing, and even obstacle course racing.
Has it been easy,No.
In the past three years I've lost two jobs, been working full time and going to school full time.
Found out that I'm going blind, I've had a total of 4 eye surgery's, and had to go on immune suppressing medication.
And now have to deal with COVID.
But through this I was not unemployed for more than a month, before I landed a new job with no effect on my income, and no lapse in my insurance.
I was just awarded my second scholarship in 3 years did that I can continue my education.
My family and I are safe and healthy.
Both mentally and physically, thru all the storms that we have been  thru.
So over the hill I am not.
Have I seen and been thru a lot in a half a century.
You better believe it.
But I am better, stronger, and ready to face 50 head on.
Soo here's to another 50, bring it on.😁👍
